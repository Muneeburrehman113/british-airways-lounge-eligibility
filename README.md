# British Airways Lounge Eligibility â€“ Heathrow Terminal 3

This repository contains my work on the **Forage British Airways Data Science Job Simulation**.  
The task focuses on analyzing the **Summer 2019 Heathrow Terminal 3 flight schedule** to estimate the number of passengers eligible for the lounge.  

## Contents
- **Task 1:**  
  - Data exploration of the schedule (seats, regions, time of day, haul type).  
  - Grouping logic for flight categories.  
  - Lookup table with estimated percentages for Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 passengers.  
  - Justification of assumptions and scalability considerations.  

- **Task 2 (Coming Soon):**  
  Further analysis and business recommendations based on lookup table outputs.

## Files
- `notebook.ipynb` â€“ Jupyter Notebook with full analysis and code.  
- `lookup_table.csv` â€“ Reusable lookup table with eligibility estimates.  
- `justification.xlsx` â€“ Notes and explanation of assumptions.  

## Tools Used
- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib)  
- Jupyter Notebook
